# Project-_Luffy
It is a Spoof website that will take Inputs from the user and then randomly select crew mates among them. Each selected candidate is then given 0.01 ether as prize. The 
smart contract is deployed on Goerli Test ethereum blockchain using hardhat. For front end , we used replit kit.



Step 1:
In our local, we create the smart contract and the using react - harhat lib , we deploy t on our local blockchain(created using harhat).
This is the way to test your contract locally too.

Step 2:
After successful testin local, we can put it online on a real blockchain, We can do so by using Alchemy Dashboard.
Alchemy is an api interface that will deploy your contract on the blockchain and you can use its api later , to connect your app to the contract you made.

step 3:
We used reptil to make our app using html, css and react js. We connected
our smart contract and our app was up and running.
